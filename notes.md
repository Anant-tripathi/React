#### components advantages
1. easy structure => 
2. Re-use => components that are reoccuring

#### points
1. npm start is defined in package.json
2. 

components are functions that return UI
component names are to start in upper case or rendering fails

a fragment is used to encapsulate multiple tags into one and eliminates the need to use div or other tags unnecessarily (<></>)

Start component names with capital letters

components that are passed in tags in react are called props and they are used to make components dynamic and are passed in object form

props are read only not by syntax but as a practice which is strongly recommended

numbers cannot be passed in string it must be passed in expressions using {}

objects are put in double curly brackets and must be camel case

UNDERSTAND CHANNEL PROPS

{...obj} -> spread operator used to use objects in return statements ES6 syntax
